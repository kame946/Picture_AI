# Picture.ai

Picture.AI is an AI-powered web application that uses deep learning to perform image recognition and analysis. It aims to provide users with insights and predictions about the content of uploaded images.

## Overview

Picture.AI utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize objects, scenes, or patterns within images. Users can upload an image through the web interface, and the application will process the image using the AI model to generate predictions and display the results.

The application has a social cause element, as it can be used to help visually impaired individuals understand the content of images or provide assistance in various fields such as healthcare, wildlife conservation, and environmental monitoring.
